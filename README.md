# Academic Management System

This is a simple, modular **Python-based project** designed to manage and organize academic data such as students, courses, departments, batches, and examination records. All data is stored and handled using **CSV files**, making this system lightweight and easy to run without requiring a database.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.py` – The main entry point to run the system and access all modules.
- `student.py` – Handles student-related data operations.
- `course.py` – Manages course details and interactions.
- `department.py` – Maintains department information.
- `batch.py` – Tracks batch-level details.
- `examination.py` – Stores and manages exam data.
- `.csv files` – Contain corresponding data for each module (e.g., `student.csv`, `course.csv`, etc.).

## 🧠 Features

- Add, update, view, and delete records for:
  - Students
  - Courses
  - Departments
  - Batches
  - Examinations
- File-based data storage using CSV for easy portability.
- Modular codebase, with separate Python files for each entity.

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses built-in Python modules only)
